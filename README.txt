A simple little game compiled with Qt(open source version for personal users) based on Dev-C++. This is just a basic project for personal practice and school homework. Inspired by the traditional five-in-a-row game, I apply a go board and a couple of free source material to manage this six-in-a-row game.

ATTENTION:
Put the .sav files in an English path or you'll not be able to save/load the game correctly.
